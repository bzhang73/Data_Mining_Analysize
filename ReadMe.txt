The problem1-5.py is for the problem 1,2,3,4,5
Execude the code:
python3 problem1-5

PS:
I write a file named statistics.data, in this file include the statistics of each name value max, min, mean, std_v value. This file is using to fill the empty data.
The kmeans_output.data is the output of the kMeans cluster result
The pca_kmeans_output.data is the output of the PCA reduce dimension to 90% the kMeans cluster result

Then for the problem 6 is the file autoencoder_problem6.py
To execute the code:
python3 autoencoder_problem6.py

PS:
But I write a file of data.xls, it include the clean up data and the result of K-Means results labels, then I use this data to test my autoencoder neural network models.


PS:
python3 version is 3.7.1
